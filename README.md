# COVID-19 Spread in the U.S. and Temperature: a Statistical Analysis

Thanks for clicking on my project!


Here is the detailed [summary](https://github.com/seaneli/CHRP-Competition-Repository/blob/master/Presentation1.pdf) of my project, typed neatly for you, with LaTeX.


### Brief Summary:

Understanding the relationship between disease spread and temperature is important for effectively distributing resources across the country, and for predicting how the disease will effect us over time. We perform a detailed analysis of the correlation between COVID-19 rate of spread in the U.S., and local temperature. Our analysis consists of: 

1. **Estimating the COVID spread rate in each of several communities.** We do this using a first order linear difference approximation for the case totals (i.e. the discrete first derivative of the case totals in a given community); we also use the daily multiplicative factors (i.e. by what factor did the case total multiply from day i to day i+1).

2. **Several temperature variables.** Our data from the NOAA consists of daily temperature maximums, minimums, and averages, for several communities. We account for the **variable incubation relate/testing delay** by offsetting temperature and rate data, from 0 days to 2 weeks.

3. **Multiple testing and regression** We have two rate measurements, three temperature variables, 15 possible temperature offsets, and three correlation test statistics (Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman).  



Again, thanks for clicking, and hope you enjoy! Constructive criticism and questions are very welcome.
