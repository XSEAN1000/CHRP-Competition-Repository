# R code 

Here is my R code. It is broken into several pieces (in one r script) I am not sure how to make it so the reader can load in the same data, 
but I have included the data files I used in other data folders.

1. import the data
2. organize the data
3. introduce my functions
4. what PWE approximations do
5. hypothesis testing and plotting
